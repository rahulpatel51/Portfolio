## 📤 Google Sheets Integration  

The contact form is integrated with Google Sheets using **FormSubmit**. When a user submits their name, email, and message, the data is automatically saved in your Google Sheet.  

### 🔧 How It Works  
1. The form sends the data to **FormSubmit**, which then forwards it to your Google Sheets.  
2. This is done securely without any backend code.  

### 🌐 How to Set Up  
1. Go to **FormSubmit** ([https://formsubmit.co](https://formsubmit.co))  
2. Enter your email and get a custom endpoint URL.  
3. Update the form action in `index.html` with your custom URL.  
4. Your Google Sheet will now receive form submissions automatically.
